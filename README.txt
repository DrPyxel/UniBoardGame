Playing Instructions:
This game is a board game. The player must gather as many points as possible in order to win. Starting the game is simple. Just right click the center of the board to roll the die. You may move the player clockwise on the board using the arrow keys. The game will automatically stop the player after they move a certain number of squares based on the number you rolled. Depending on the square that the player stops on, a minigame will be initiated. All minigames have an equal point opportunity and have instructions displayed when the game starts. 

Possible minigames:
PE: Dodgeball (Color: Rainbow)
This is a two-player minigame! One player, the main player will compete against the challenger against the clock to gain points. On the court are three balls which can be picked up one at a time and thrown. Players can hide behind naturally spawning obstacles to hide from the ball. The game ends if one player gets hit or if time runs out. Player 1 will use the arrow keys and Player 2 will use the WASD keys. Player 2 is randomly chosen by the game. Note that only Player 1 will receive any points from the minigame. Player 2’s job is to block Player 1 from getting as many points.

Math: Pop Quiz (Color: Blue)
The player will be presented with a piece of paper, and on it are several questions. The player can get a certain number of points by getting answers right. When you think you have an answer, hit the space bar. If it is right it will take you to the gameboard. If not you will have to keep inputing numbers until its right. If the answer in negative, refresh the page. 

French: Make a Crêpe (Color: Orange. ALL FOREIGN LANGUAGES ARE RED NO MATTER WHAT)
The player is presented with a small bar with a slider. By pressing the SPACEBAR, the player can stop the slider and flip the crêpe, granting them a certain number of points depending on the timing of the flip.

Spanish: Taco Catch (Color: Purple)
The player will control a taco shell. The taco will be used to catch certain ingredients which award a certain number of points, while avoiding the nasty sauce which will lose the player points.

World History: Lights Out (Color: Yellow)
The player will find themselves in a dark cave. To win, they must find the artifact by searching the dark area. The player gets points depending on how quickly they can find the artifact.

Art: Free Draw (Color: Red)
The player is presented with a piece of paper. The player can draw on the blackboard for as long as they want. When they are done, hit the space bar, which will teleport you to the gameboard. 

You will be Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, or Student 4. You will move with the arrow keys in the board and will roll the die in an orderly fashion.

Have fun!
