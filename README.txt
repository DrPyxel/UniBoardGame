In order to install this game, you can download this off of GitHub from the master branch.
Upon downloading, you must unzip the folder and create a HTTP server for the directory that contains the files. Here is a link on how to do so: https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part2
Alternatively, one can simply navigate to drpyxel.github.io/UniBoardGame to play the game in your browser.

Playing Instructions:
This game is a board game. The player must gather as many points as possible in order to win. Starting the game is simple. Just right click the center of the board to roll the die. You may move the player clockwise on the board using the arrow keys. The game will automatically stop the player after they move a certain number of squares based on the number you rolled. Depending on the square that the player stops on, a minigame will be initiated. All minigames have an equal point opportunity and have instructions displayed when the game starts. The game ends when all players have circled the board 5 times (which is the equivalent of staying at Uni for five years). The game automatically tallies up scores and awards victory to the correct player.

Possible minigames:
PE: Dodgeball (Color: White and/or Rainbow)
This is a two-player minigame! One player, the main player will compete against the challenger against the clock to gain points. On the court are three balls which can be picked up one at a time and thrown. Players can hide behind naturally spawning obstacles to hide from the ball. The game ends if one player gets hit or if time runs out. Player 1 will use the arrow keys and Player 2 will use the WASD keys. Player 2 is randomly chosen by the game. Note that only Player 1 will receive any points from the minigame. Player 2’s job is to block Player 1 from getting as many points.

UNI Artifacts:
UNI Artifacts are a bonus. Each one corresponds to each character. The four artifacts are a Prox Card, Bubble Tea, Gargoyle, and a Locker. The Prox Card gives you an extra turn whenever you want (Student 2), the Bubble Tea gives you an extra roll (Student 3), the Gargoyle (Student 1) immediately gives you 10 extra points, and the Locker switch points with another student (Student 4). Please note that you may only use your UNI Artifact once per year. 

Entering the Game:
The first thing you will do as soon as you get onto the game is choose a character. There are four characters: Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, and Student 4. Each one will have a particular UNI card (see above). Then you will choose a foreign language class and a an elective. Here are some choices that you will have to make:

- Choose a character
    Student 1
    Student 2
    Student 3
    Student 4

- Choose a Language
    French
    Latin
    German
    Spanish
    Japanese

- Choose an elective
    Orchestra
    Chorus

You will then be teleported to the actual board game. Student 1 will always go first. All of the students will be moving with the arrow keys in the board and will roll the die in an orderly fashion. You will go around the board five times. This represents the five years that a typical Uni student will go through.

Have fun!
